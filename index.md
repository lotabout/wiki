# Static Wiki

Static wiki is a client side wiki for pure markdown. All you need is a simple file
server(Github Pages is enough) to serve files and a browser to actually view.

Static-wiki is hosted on [Github:
static-wiki](https://github.com/lotabout/static-wiki) See [README](README.md)
for detail documentation.

Any suggestions and comments, use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/lotabout/static-wiki/issues)

I know I am bad at naming...

## Code Sample

```c
int main() {
    printf("hello world");
}
```
