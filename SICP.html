<h3 id="toc_1.2.1">4B Generic Operator</h3>

<p>
Generator Operator is a way to overcome vertical difference of
representations.
</p>
<blockquote>
BOSS LAYER
--------------------------------------
Same API
--------------------------------------
MATHA           | | GEORGE
<table class='center'>
<tr>
<td>
&nbsp;
</td>
</tr>
</table>
different       | |
representation  | |
<table class='center'>
<tr>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dispatch system is one way to solve it.
</p>

<p>
&gt; it's called data-directed programming
&gt; Data itself contains the information on how to operate on them.
</p>

<p>
The importance of Generic Operator is that it is a very good way to achieve
abstraction. {01:08:15}

<p>
CONCEPT: De-Centralized Control
</p>

<p>
Q1. How to choose which representation when making a new object
Details:
</p>
<blockquote>
As we see, the representation will be unified when seeing from the above.
Like 'real-part' 'img-part' in the example. But if we want to build a new
object, like 'make-complex', how to achieve it? Which implementation should
we choose automatically?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
for example, (+c george matha) would result in (make-complex XXX XXX) which
'make-complex' should we choose?
</blockquote>


<h3 id="toc_1.2.2">5 Assignments, States, and Side Effects</h3>

<p>
Assignment represents <strong>time</strong>: it means that it defines a time, the state of a
variable is changed before and after this time.
</p>

<p>
Also, it introduced state local to a procedure, by which we don't have to
reveal all the details of a procedure. And thus we can have objects without
have to know all what's inside.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.2.3">6 Streams</h3>

<p>
8 Quene's Problem.
</p>

<p>
Using <strong>backtrack</strong> is hard to understand. That's because it takes <em>time</em> into
consideration.
</p>

<p>
Using stream is a lot more easier.
</p>

<p>
One problem of stream is that we will have to construct all the stream items
before using it. In some cases they are not even needed.
</p>

<p>
Thus we need <strong>lazy evaluation</strong>. That is so-called "On Demand Data Structure".
</p>

<p>
Actually, if we <strong>delay</strong> all the arguments when applying a function, we'll
natually get the power of stream processing.
</p>

<p>
One problem this introduce is that <strong>lazy evaluation</strong> is gonna miss up with
<strong>assignment</strong>. This is why functional programming language like "Haskell" don't
have assignment at all.
</p>

<p>
The essence behind this is <strong>time</strong> information. With pure functional
programming, there is no way to actually get the <strong>time</strong> information. And this
affects our view of the word in programming.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.2.4">7 Metacircular Evaluation</h3>

<p>
<em>Y Combinator</em>
</p>

<pre>
    Y = (λ (f)
           (λ (x x) (f (x x)))
           (λ (x x) (f (x x))))
    (Y F) =&gt; (F (F (F ... )))
</pre>

<p>
That means (Y F) is a way to find a fix point of function <em>F</em>. Thus if we
iterate the <em>eval</em> and <em>apply</em>, we'll finally get what <em>Lisp</em> is.
</p>

<p>
One more thing to note is the convergence of function F. Normally it's verty
hard to decide whether or not F is convergent at the very beginning.
</p>

<p>
What's the use of a metacircular evaluator?
</p>

<p>
The obvious one is two test new features. Adding new features to it and test
it as it is.
</p>

<p>
Lexical Binding VS Dynamic Binding.
</p>

<p>
Lexical Binding is when construct 'lambda' expressions, we also capture its
environments, while bynamic binding evaluates a 'lambda' according its running
environment.
</p>

<p>
Dynamic binding has a very serious problem: modularity disaster, which is that
when we write a module, the names we use in it matters outside the module.
</p>

<p>
How to get dynamic binding feature in a lexical environment? =&gt; Wrap it with a
'lambda', who captures the dynamic variables.
